# Breast Cancer Analysis Using Ensemble Modeling :-
# Key facts :-
Breast cancer caused 670 000 deaths globally in 2022.
Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age.
Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in 157 countries out of 185 in 2022.
Breast cancer occurs in every country in the world.
Approximately 0.5â€“1% of breast cancers occur in men.

# Overview -

Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal.

Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening. 

Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal.

Treatment is based on the person, the type of cancer and its spread. Treatment combines surgery, radiation therapy and medications.

# Signs of Breast Cancer:-

1. Weight loss
2. Skin changes
3. Pain
4. Breast changes
   
This project uses mammograms for breast cancer detection using deep learning techniques.

For the diagnosis of breast cancer doctors often use additional tests to find or diagnose breast cancer. A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast. Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer. Regular mammograms are the best tests doctors have to find breast cancer early, sometimes up to three years before it can be felt. A mammogram shows how dense the breasts are. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of getting breast cancer.

# Results:-
The results of the ensemble model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be displayed after running the ensemble_model.py script.
